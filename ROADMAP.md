# ROADMAP

Here some ideas that I want to implement, the order is not important:

- Blob storage (filesytem os.OpenInRoot)
- Email with resend
- AI integration
  - AI functions available in lua code
- AUTH
- Secrets
  - Like env, but read only and not displayed in the ui
- Choose a good name for this project
- Create a nice logo
- Metrics functions available in lua code
- Pub Sub
- Be able to call other functions
- Cron/scheduling events
- Add a dockerfile for easy deployment
- Improve the way the state is handled in the UI
- Re-evalute mithriljs
- Consider store events in the execution
- Dashboard with calls metrics
- Consider functions implemented in webassemply (wazero)
- Consider an api to update the function and env
  - zip + manifest file
